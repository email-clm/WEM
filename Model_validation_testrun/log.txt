Is the simulation if calibration (You could check one grid during simulation)
 Input '1' for YES, Input '0' for NO.

How many time do you want to spin up (simulation using the first year data and calcualte on annual basis): 
50The total day number for model simulation (spin up included) is: 30660 Days
The total day number for model simulation (spin up excluded) is: 12410 Days
Do you have the solar radiation data: 0 for NO, 1 for Solar radiation, 2 for PAR
